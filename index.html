          Hi, I am Anna
        </h2>
        <p>
          I am a professional dancer
        </p>

      	<h2>What about me?</h2>
			<p>
				From when I can remember myself I dance and work out. As a kid I started with gymnastics and later I turned into 
				classical athletism. At the same time I used to dance in school performances and created choreographies with my friends
				presented them at our parents and classmates. When somebody was asking me what I am gonna be when I grow up I used to say
				teacher or fitness instructor. And I did it!! After highscool I studied at Kapodistrian University of Athens in the Department of Sports and Physical Education.
				At the smae time I started my professional diploma for Latin and Ballroom Dancing. I started teaching Latin dances before finish my postgraduate degree. On the last year I choose 
				Greek Traditional Dance for my specialization and my thesis was about "The represantation of women at second existance of dance in Greece and Brasil" which took a 10 out of 10!
				I became accepted in Rohampton University for a Master at Dance Anthropology and at the University of Edinburgh for a Master in Science of Dance Education. I choose the second one
				but I never did it as I wanted to focus on dancesport. I used to dance 10 dances in competitions Latin and Ballroom International Style.
				My love for Latin American culture brougth me in touch with Salsa and Bachata and from 2010 with African dance Kizomba. In 2016 I decided to stop competitions and focus
				more on Kizomba. I did trainings with AfroLatin Connection in Portugal and started teaching and performing in some of the biggest festivals in Greece, Turkey and Berlin.
				The last years I have turned my focus on the healing role of dance and clinical fitness. I created a method with choreotherapy approach called "EcstAfro" which help people to release themselves into 
				primitive roots of humanity and express their emotions fearless. As I see human as an holistic creature I couldn't but being intrested in the healing tecnhique of massage. My passion about massage is Myofascial Release.
				Fascia runs in all of our body and its appropriate function is vital for our health.
